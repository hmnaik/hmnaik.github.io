# About me  
I love to take naps. Preferably below a tree with a good view of the sky through the canopy.   
I can look at plants, trees and birds for hours and hours. If possible I play percussion instruments from time to time. Lately, I have started sketching to kill time and I like to send post cards to friends. I Love traving in general but I have special love for travelling in India.
