# About me  
I am Hemal Naik. I am an Indian citizen living and working in Germany since 2010. Citizenship is mentioned because I am most regularly reminded about it by visa authorities of different countries that I visit for work or pleasure. 

## Job profile
Post-doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). 
I develop tech (computer vision - machine learning) solutions for studying wildlife. 
I also collaborate and work with different art institutions for exploring alternative ways of communicating. 

### Current projects
Project MELA (Mating Ecology of Leking Antelopes) at [Ecology of Animal Societies](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot) and [Centre of Advanced Study of Collective Behavior](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/).
As part of MELA, I am also an exchange [fellow](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/en/person/hemal-naik/) at [Akademie Schloss Solitude](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/en/) under the [_FieldTrip_](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/de/news/cooperation-with-max-planck-institut/) initiative and I am currently developing my own art project around the theme of project MELA.

## Interests 
I love to take naps below a tree while staring at the sky through the canopy.   
I go out to see plants, trees and birds for hours and hours. I play percussion instruments from time to time and can sketch for hours to kill time or to send post cards to friends. 
Love traving in general but I have special love for travelling within India. 
These days I am trying become a good storyteller and explore my artistic side. 
I am trying to combine different aspects of my life and this attempt brings me to explore the idea of combining science with art.  
You can read more about my attempts on [side projects and art collaborations](/docs/about/outreach) page.
