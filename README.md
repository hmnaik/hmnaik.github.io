# About me  
I am a nature enthusiast. I love to take naps below a tree while staring at the sky through the canopy.   
I go out to see plants, trees and birds for hours and hours. I play percussion instruments from time to time and can sketch for hours to kill time or to send post cards to friends. I Love traving in general but I have special love for travelling within India. These days I am trying become a storyteller and explore my artistic side with audio-visual art projects. 
I am trying to combine different aspects of my life and this attempt brings me to explore the idea of combining science with art.
