# About me  
I love to take naps below a tree while staring at the sky through the canopy.   
I go out to see plants, trees and birds for hours and hours. I play percussion instruments from time to time and can sketch for hours to kill time or to send post cards to friends. I Love traving in general but I have special love for travelling within India. These days I am trying become a storyteller and explore my artistic side with audio-visual art projects. 
I am trying to combine different aspects of my life and this attempt brings me to explore the idea of combining science with art.

## Work life
Post-doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). 
I am working on CV (computer vision), ML (machine learning), AR (Augmenred reality), VR (Virtual Reality).
Currently, I am working as technology developer for wildlife research (birds, mammals) in indoor and outdoor environments.  
I use art to find alternative ways of communicating.
