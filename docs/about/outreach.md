## Outreach 

I like to walk and always look forward to having some free time to go for birding. If I can not find birds I see insects, trees and whatever else that is around. My love for Himalayas is something I have not measured but there is a lingering hope that I would do a project there and live there for a while. 
I am involved in science outreach activities and mental helath invitives at Uni Konstanz and MPI-AB. I have given talks at different public events mainly about [ICARUS](https://www.icarus.mpg.de/en) project. You can find more information about my Outreach activities [Here](/about/page).
