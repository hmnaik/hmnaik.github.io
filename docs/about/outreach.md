## Philosophy

I like to walk and always look forward to having some free time to go for birding. If I can not find birds I see insects, trees and whatever else that is around. 
I love chilling in the Himalayas and I have a lingering hope that one day I would do a project there and get live there for a while. 
My love for nature inspired me to get involved science outreach activities. I have given talks at different public events mainly about  project. You can find more information about my Outreach activities [Here](/about/page).
