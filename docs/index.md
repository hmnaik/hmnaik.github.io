I am working on project MELA (Mating Ecology of Leking Antelopes) which is support by [Ecology of Animal Societies](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot) and [Centre of Advanced Study of Collective Behavior](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/).

### Online presence 

I have love and hate relationships with my social media accounts. There are times when I am very active and there are times when I am not.  
I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmnaik) to promote science and cool stuff from other people that I like to share. Sometimes, I am more free and motivated I make random videos about my scientific work or just anything around me, you can check out some videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFERZcpt3g0wQzTgtil1HIA?view_as=subscriber). I like to make sketches and I upload my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/walking_naik/?hl=en). Finally, I like to write short stories as well, you can check out [Medium](https://medium.com/@hemalnaik) for some of these stories.
