## Aim of life 

> I would like to be remembered for my love of sleeping below a trees and looking at the sky.

### Who am I? 
I am an engineer and a scientist by profession. Personally, I am trying to learn the art of story telling and a science communication. My favorite mode of transportation is walking. I am always looking to have some free time and go for birding. If I can not find birds I see insects, trees and whatever else that is around. My love for Himalayas is something I have not measured but there is a lingering hope that I would do a project there and live there for a while. 

### What do I do for living? 
I am working at [Centre of Advanced Study of Collective Behavior] (https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/) as a postdoc. I am hosted by the [Visual Computing Group](https://www.cgmi.uni-konstanz.de/) at the University of Konstanz. I am also a guest researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). 

Additionally, I am involved in science outreach activities and mental helath invitives at Uni Konstanz and MPI-AB. I have given talks at different public events mainly about [ICARUS] (https://www.icarus.mpg.de/en) project. You can find more information about my Outreach activities [Here](/about/page).  

### Online presence 

I have love and hate relationships with my social media accounts. There are times when I am very active and there are times when I am not.  
I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmnaik) to promote science and cool stuff from other people that I like to share. Sometimes, I am more free and motivated I make random videos about my scientific work or just anything around me, you can check out some videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFERZcpt3g0wQzTgtil1HIA?view_as=subscriber). I like to make sketches and I upload my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/walking_naik/?hl=en). Finally, I like to write short stories as well, you can check out [Medium](https://medium.com/@hemalnaik) for some of these stories.
