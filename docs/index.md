# About me  
I am Hemal Naik. I am an Indian currently working and living in Germany. I am a scientist by profession. 
I am working towards developing tech solutions to study wildlife. 
Currently, I as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). 

## Current project
Project MELA (Mating Ecology of Leking Antelopes) at [Ecology of Animal Societies](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot) and [Centre of Advanced Study of Collective Behavior](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/).

## My interests
I love taking naps in the outdoors, sleeping below a tree while staring at the sky is one of my favorite activity. 
When time permits I like going out to spend time in nature and see plants, trees and birds. I am trying to learn how to become a good storyteller. 
I think it would be awesome to combine my research work with a bit of storytelling to explore new idea of doing science outreach.
