## Aim of life 

> If there is one thing I love to do is to sleep below the trees and look at the clouds. 

### What do I do for living? 
I am a scientist. 

### Social media

I have love and hate relationships with my social media accounts. 
I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmnaik) to promoting science and cool stuff that I like to stare. Sometimes, I am more free and motivated I make random videos about my scientific work or just anything around me, you can check out some videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFERZcpt3g0wQzTgtil1HIA?view_as=subscriber). I like to make sketches and I upload my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/walking_naik/?hl=en). Finally, I like to write short stories as well, you can check out [Medium](https://medium.com/@hemalnaik) for some of these stories.
