## Ambition
Just want to be known as the guy who likes to take a nap below trees and look at the sky for hours with no particular aim.

### Interests 
Nature, Animals, Birdwatching, Computer Vision, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Sketching.

### Professional life as engineer and a scientist 
I am using my tech expertise to study wildlife. Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/). I am working on project MELA (Mating Ecology of Leking Antelopes) which is support by [Ecology of Animal Societies](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot) and [Centre of Advanced Study of Collective Behavior](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/).

### Science outreach : Art and Science
I am trying to learn the art of story telling and explore the role of art in science communication. I am working with several art institutes in Germany.  

### Personal : 
I like to walk and always look forward to having some free time to go for birding. If I can not find birds I see insects, trees and whatever else that is around. My love for Himalayas is something I have not measured but there is a lingering hope that I would do a project there and live there for a while. 

### Initiatives 
I am involved in science outreach activities and mental helath invitives at Uni Konstanz and MPI-AB. I have given talks at different public events mainly about [ICARUS](https://www.icarus.mpg.de/en) project. You can find more information about my Outreach activities [Here](/about/page).  

### Social media
I have love and hate relationships with my social media accounts. There are times when I am very active and there are times when I am not.
